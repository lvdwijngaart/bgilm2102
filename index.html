        <p>Happy happy happy birthday💖 25 years old but still ✨slaying✨. <br />Since you're on the other side of the world I can't give you a physical hug, but with through this way I want to give you a digital birthday hug&kiss. <br />I love you and I hope that you have the best day exploring your new home city. Since I'm not there to give you a physical gift, <br />I wanted to make something to show how much I appreciate you for everything we've done together and for your forever love and support. <br />Thank you Betty for these past 3 - 3,5 years, you truly are so special.  </p>
